\begin{problema}{Cut Ribbon}{Standard}{Standard}{CodeForces}


Polycarpus has a ribbon, its length is $n$. He wants to cut the ribbon in a way that fulfils the following two conditions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item After the cutting each ribbon piece should have length $a$, $b$ or $c$. \\
 
\item After the cutting the number of ribbon pieces should be maximum. \\
\end{itemize} 


Help Polycarpus and find the number of ribbon pieces after the required cutting.




\InputFile

The first line contains four space-separated integers $n$, $a$, $b$ and $c$ ($1 \leq n,a,b,c \leq 4000$) - the length of the original ribbon and the acceptable lengths of the ribbon pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ can coincide.  \\ 


\OutputFile

Print a single number - the maximum possible number of ribbon pieces. It is guaranteed that at least one correct ribbon cutting exists. \\



\Example

\input ejemplos/cut.txt

Note: In the first example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 2, the second piece has length 3. \\

In the second example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 5, the second piece has length 2.
